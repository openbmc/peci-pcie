      "message": "It\u0027s looking a lot better, just a couple more issues to resolve.\n\nIn this check, capabilityID hasn\u0027t been initialized, so there is a remote chance that it could be a match.\n\nIf I understand correctly, this while loop is attempting to find the correct capability struct by ID.  If you change this to a do-while, then you won\u0027t check the capabilityID uninitialized here.\n\nInstead, set a do here and the while at line 297 in place of the if().  That way, the first loop will get and check the first capability ID, then continue looping until it finds the capAddress with the correct capabilityID where it will exit the loop and get the reading on line 305.  Would that work?",
